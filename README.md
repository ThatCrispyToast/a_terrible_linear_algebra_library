#### a_terrible_linear_algebra_library

The core library. This is where I write the majority of my borderline-nauseating code.


#### tests

This is where I test my functions by comparing their results with numpy's. God help us.

#### examples

Sample programs that make use of my library. Like using a chainsaw to slice tomatoes.
